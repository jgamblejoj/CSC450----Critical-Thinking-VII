# CSC450----Critical-Thinking-VII

For your Portfolio Project, you will demonstrate an understanding of the various concepts discussed in each module. For the first part of your Portfolio Project, you will create a C++ application that will exhibit concurrency concepts. Your application should create two threads that will act as counters. One thread should count up to 20. Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0. For your created code, provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application. Specifically, address:

Performance issues with concurrency
Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings
Security of the data types exhibited.
Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application, the results and your GIT repository in a single document.
